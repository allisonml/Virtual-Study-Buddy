# Your Virtual Study Buddy

## About

**Main features:**
- list of tasks to complete
   - can filter to shorter priority list to feel less overwhelmed
- interval timer to stay focused (classic pomodoro 25/5, 15min long break, potentially animedoro also)
- cute study buddy character with words of encouragement and reminders to help build good study habits

This app is meant to keep you focused and accountable for your independent studies. 
The timer and built-in task list helps to reduce procrastination while the cute interface motivates users to use it 
to stay on task and not disappoint their study buddy. The intended audience is high school and university students, though it should be usable for students as young as 13
and adult workers alike (maybe working from home!).  

I came up with this idea because I wanted something that helps keep me on task (hence the timer), 
motivates me to keep working (There's nothing like the satisfaction of crossing of each little task off a list!), 
and looks cute (because studying shouldn't be rigid and boring)! The addition of the character's messages to remind you, 
for example, to drink water or sit up straight help to encourage users to maintain healthy habits
while they may be studying for long periods of time. I may also add a feature to customize habit reminders during
break sessions (eg. do some stretches, tidy desk area, stream of consciousness) to allow users to make use of their 
few minutes of break time each day and be able to see its impact over time. Students have to study to succeed, but it 
shouldn't be the only thing they do. This app helps students to make sure to take care of themselves as a whole
while they study, helping them to stay healthy (unlike me getting lost in making this app and forgetting to eat dinner 
until 8pm), not burn out, and maybe have just a little more fun along the way.

If you look online, there are many "study with me" livestreams or videos with thousands or even millions of views.
This would be like an application of that where instead they have a cute virtual study buddy character/animal to study 
with, who will be available at any time, whether you have internet or not, and not only keeps you accountable for your
work, but also your health and habits.

Some potential additional features:
- Customizable intervals
- Choose your study buddy avatar
- Snack Recipe and/or Study Tips tab that becomes available when not on "focus" mode
- Customizable habits/reminder messages
